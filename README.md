# Daily Work Logger

## My Problem
I need to track my work hours ticket by ticket, but it gets messy. I often end up quickly jotting them down in notepads or random places. Using the company app feels slow and cumbersome, and keeping everything clear can be frustrating.

## How This Helps
Click start to quickly quickly start a timer and jot down a description. 
The app calculates the total duration for each entry and tracks break times.

## Behind the Scenes
Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Can be used locally without a server.  
Run `node build.js` to merge the Javascript files int a single dist/bundle.js.
